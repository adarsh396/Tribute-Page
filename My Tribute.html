       <center> <h1>Bhagat Singh</h1></center><main class="first">
        <img src="1.jpg" width="500px" height="290px"></main>
        
            <p>Bhagat Singh (27 September 1907[a] – 23 March 1931) was a charismatic Indian revolutionary[6]
                 who participated in the mistaken murder of a junior British police officer[7] in what was to be retaliation
                  for the death of an Indian nationalist.[8] He later took part in a largely symbolic bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly 
                  in Delhi and a hunger strike in jail, which—on the back of sympathetic coverage in Indian-owned newspapers—turned him into a household
                   name in the Punjab region, and after his execution at age 23 into a martyr and folk hero in Northern India.[9]
                 Borrowing ideas from Bolshevism and anarchism,[10][11][12][13][14] he electrified a growing militancy in India in the 1930s, and prompted 
                 urgent introspection within the Indian National Congress's nonviolent but eventually successful campaign for India's independence.[15]

                In December 1928, Bhagat Singh and an associate, Shivaram Rajguru, both members of a small revolutionary group, the Hindustan Socialist
                 Republican Association (also Army, or HSRA), shot dead a 21-year-old British police officer, John Saunders, in Lahore, Punjab, in what 
                 is today Pakistan, mistaking Saunders, who was still on probation, for the British senior police superintendent, James Scott, whom they
                  had intended to assassinate.[16] They held Scott responsible for the death of a popular Indian nationalist leader Lala Lajpat Rai for having
                   ordered a lathi (baton) charge in which Rai was injured and two weeks thereafter died of a heart attack. As Saunders exited a police station
                    on a motorcycle, he was felled by a single bullet fired from across the street by Rajguru, a marksman.[17][18] As he lay injured, he was shot
                     at close range several times by Singh, the postmortem report showing eight bullet wounds.[19] Another associate of Singh, Chandra Shekhar Azad,
                      shot dead an Indian police head constable, Channan Singh, who attempted to give chase as Singh and Rajguru fled.[17][18]
            <br>After having escaped, Bhagat Singh and his associates used pseudonyms to publicly announce avenging Lajpat Rai's death, putting up prepared posters that they
             had altered to show John Saunders as their intended target instead of James Scott.[17] Singh was thereafter on the run for many months, and no convictions resulted at the time.
              Surfacing again in April 1929, he and another associate, Batukeshwar Dutt, set off two low-intensity homemade bombs among 
               unoccupied benches of the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi. They showered leaflets from the gallery on the legislators below, shouted slogans,
               and allowed the authorities to arrest them.[20] The arrest, and the resulting publicity, brought to light Singh's complicity in the John Saunders case.
                Awaiting trial, Singh gained public sympathy after he joined fellow defendant Jatin Das in a hunger strike, demanding better prison conditions for Indian prisoners,
                 the strike ending in Das's death from starvation in September 1929.

            Bhagat Singh was convicted of the murder of John Saunders and Channan Singh, and hanged in March 1931, aged 23.
             He became a popular folk hero after his death. Jawaharlal Nehru wrote about him: "Bhagat Singh did not become popular because of his act of terrorism but because he seemed to vindicate, 
             for the moment, the honour of Lala Lajpat Rai, and through him of the nation. He became a symbol; the act was forgotten, the symbol remained, and within a few months
              each town and village of the Punjab, and to a lesser extent in the rest of northern India, resounded with his name."[21] In still later years, Singh, an atheist and
               socialist in adulthood, won admirers in India from among a political spectrum that included both communists and right-wing Hindu nationalists. Although many of Singh's associates,
                as well as many Indian anti-colonial revolutionaries, were also involved in daring acts and were either executed or died violent deaths, few came to be lionised in popular art and literature 
                as did Singh, who is sometimes referred to as the Shaheed-e-Azam ("Great martyr" in Urdu and Punjabi).[22]</p>

<h3>Bal GangaDhar Tilak</h3>
<p class="second">Bal Gangadhar Tilak (pronunciation (help·info); born Keshav Gangadhar Tilak[3][4] 
    (pronunciation: [keʃəʋ ɡəŋɡaːd̪ʱəɾ ʈiɭək]); 23 July 1856 – 1 August 1920), endeared as Lokmanya (IAST:
     Lokmānya), was an Indian nationalist, teacher, 
    and an independence activist. He was one third of the Lal Bal Pal triumvirate.[5]
     Tilak was the first leader of the Indian independence movement. The British 
     
     colonial authorities called him "The father of the Indian unrest". He was also conferred with the 
     title of "Lokmanya", which means "accepted by the people as their leader".[6] Mahatma Gandhi called him 
     
     "The Maker of Modern India".[7]

    Tilak was one of the first and strongest advocates of Swaraj ('self-rule') and a strong radical in Indian consciousness.
     He is known for his quote in Marathi: "Swaraj is my birthright and I shall have it!". He formed a close alliance with many
      Indian National Congress leaders including Bipin Chandra Pal, Lala Lajpat Rai, Aurobindo Ghose, V. O. Chidambaram Pillai and Muhammad Ali Jinnah.<br>
      Keshav Gangadhar Tilak was born on 23 July 1856 in an Marathi Hindu Chitpavan Brahmin family in Ratnagiri, 
      the headquarters of the Ratnagiri district of present-day Maharashtra (then Bombay Presidency).[1] His ancestral village was Chikhali.
       His father, Gangadhar Tilak was a school teacher and a Sanskrit scholar who died when Tilak was sixteen. 
       In 1871, Tilak was married to Tapibai (Née Bal) when he was sixteen, a few months before his father's death.
        After marriage, her name was changed to Satyabhamabai. He obtained his Bachelor of Arts in first class in Mathematics from Deccan College of Pune in 1877.
         He left his M.A. course of study midway to join the L.L.B course instead, and in 1879 he obtained his L.L.B degree from Government Law College.[8]
          After graduating, Tilak started teaching mathematics at a private school in Pune. Later, due to ideological differences with the colleagues in the new school,
           he withdrew and became a journalist. Tilak actively participated in public affairs. He stated: "Religion and practical life are not different.
            The real spirit is to make the country your family instead of working only for your own. The step beyond is to serve humanity and the next step is to serve God.
